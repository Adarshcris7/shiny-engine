**Breast Cancer Dataset Prediction Using DT, LogReg & K-NN**

This python notebook deals with three ML classifier models namely Decision tree, Logistic Regression and K-NN. 

Currently, all the features have been taken for the model to do train and test its data on. 

Yet to incorporate ---

Parallely, feature selection process is going on where only such features will be taken into account where it has a high impact of the prediction of labels. Also, trimming down not-so important feature variables saves computational cost and time. 
Also, grid search parameters will be applied for hyper parameter tuning and project will be updated.
Estimated timeline - By end of November 2021
